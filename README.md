/*BookPub - Decentralized Book Publishing Contract   
// Authors fund book publishing by selling licensing equity via micro crowd funding   
//------------------------------------------------------*   
  
Often, talented writers are unable to effectively distribute their work to a large audience. This may be because the deal that publishers are presenting to readers is bad for the reader, and for the writer. "Pay us $5 for an eBook, or $30 for a hard copy" de-incentivizes readers from doing what writers want them to do, READ OUR BOOK! They place this barrier between authors and readers, and then take 80%+ of the profits.

What if we could remove the barrier? Find a way to fund physical printing of books, while awarding the author compensation. Luckily, creating an eBooks is free, so one can afford to give them away which gets readers in the door. But how can you afford to print physical books? They aren't free.  

Well people understand this, and they are willing to pay for a physical book that they really care about.  
Others honestly cannot afford to pay, but does it really make sense to turn away readers?  
What if we harness the payments of the people who are willing and able to pay for a physical copy, in order to subsidize the publishing of print copies for everyone else. 

To further incentivize readers, every coin they buy represents an equity portion of licensing rights.
